# ICESat-2 sees glacier crevasses

In this toy research workflow, we are going to use ICESat-2 data to analyze glacier crevasses on the surface of a specific Arctic glacier. Although it sounds very specific to link to a certain domain of earth science, it does have the common stages for most research activities. We break these stages into the following seven concepts:

1. **Search for ideas**: You read a lot of papers and find some interesting arguments. You come up with some ideas and you want to test them. Now it's time to figure out how.
2. **Get data**: You know what data sets you are going to use. The question is they are almost always bigger than what you want. How to focus on the part you desire to get?
3. **Explore the data**: You have data in hand. Surely you can dive in them and get lost quickly, but we wonder if there is a way to dissect the data first, or at least to get a broad picture of them?
4. **Analyze the data**: Fun part. You usually have lots of ways and software tools for this, but which one is the most efficient, most scalable, most straightfoward,... or, simply to say, the best?
5. **Generate publication-ready results**: Yes you have a lot of preliminary figures and tables that look too plain. And it is such a pain in the neck to revisit and make them better. So why not generating them at the first time?
6. **Write a report**: Writing is tough, partly because you have to organize all the material you have -- text, figures, tables, equations, references, etc. What if there is such a tool for making this easier?
7. **Share and reproduce your work**: This cannot be simpler than one-click sharing and reproducing. And Binder is just for that.
